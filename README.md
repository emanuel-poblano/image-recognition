# 🏋️ Gym Form Correction AI

A **production-grade computer vision application** that analyzes exercise form in real time using a webcam or video input. The system detects body posture, counts repetitions, and provides corrective feedback for common gym exercises such as squats, push-ups, and deadlifts.

Built with **Python, MediaPipe, and OpenCV**, this project demonstrates clean architecture, real-time pose estimation, and scalable design suitable for deployment or further ML enhancement.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Real-time pose estimation using MediaPipe
* ✅ Exercise-specific form analysis (Squat, Push-up, Deadlift)
* ✅ Rep counting with state tracking
* ✅ Live visual feedback overlay
* ✅ Modular, production-ready architecture
* ✅ Robust error handling for camera and pose detection

## 📊 Metrics Tracked

* Total repetitions
* Joint angles per rep
* Depth consistency
* Form warnings frequency

These metrics can be extended to generate **session reports** or **performance scores**.

## 🧪 Testing

Run unit tests from the root directory:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
